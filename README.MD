# Project-Three
For this project we researched financial records provided by the SEC. The records detail a variety of elements: revenue, gross profit, operating and net income loss, research and development expense, selling and marketing expense, share based and allocated share based expense depreciation, cost and expenses, general and administrative expense interest expense, lease and rental expense, marketing and advertising expense, accrued liabilities, entity common stock shares, and entity public float. We looked at records for a numerous companies and decided to present our findings using the data engineering route. We conducted an analysis of the records provided by the SEC in Jupyter and were able to extract data to import onto MongoDB.
